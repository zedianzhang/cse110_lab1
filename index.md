## Introduction
I would introduce myself in the following two part:
[person](#person)
[programmer](#programmer)

### Person

This is my favovite BBQ place in downtown.
### Programmer
I am 4th year computer science student in UCSD.
and here are some class I took in the pass year:
1. CSE 151
2. CSE 105
3. CSE 100
4. CSE 140

and here is my [GitHub Page](https://github.com/zedianzhang) you can see some project I did in the past.
As a programmer, I always remember what Henry Ford said:
> The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. 
> 
so everytime I found a bug I would make a check list with following steps:
- [x]  Reproduce the problem.
- [ ]  Describe the bug. Try to get as much input from the user to get the exact reason.
- [ ]  Capture the program snapshot when the bug appears.
- [ ]  Analyse the snapshot based on the state and action
- [ ] Fix the existing bug, but also check that any new bug does not occur.

with this check list help me alot on fixing bugs. some other methor like `print` help you to see what is in the veriable.
